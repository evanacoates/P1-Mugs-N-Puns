# Mugs-N-Puns

## **Description**
Mugs-N-Puns is a website designed to create jokes and find breweries. We have a list of 5 jokes that generate everytime the search button is clicked.

We also have a list of breweries within Texas that are generated when a search button is clicked.
     
To achieve this, we used two different APIs. One API gave us a number of options for different kinds of jokes. THe other API generates the name, number, and website of different breweries.
