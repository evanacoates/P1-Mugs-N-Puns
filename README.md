# Mugs-N-Puns by Group 7

## Description
Mugs-N-Puns is a website designed to create jokes and find breweries. We have a list of 5 jokes that generate everytime the search button is clicked.

 We also have a list of breweries within Texas that are generated when a search button is clicked.
     
To achieve this, we used two different APIs. One API gave us a number of options for different kinds of jokes. THe other API generates the name, number, and website of different breweries.

## Wireframe
    We considered 4 different wireframes which are:

<img src="./Images/wireframe-2.png" alt="Image of wireframe 3">
<img src="./Images/wireframe-3.JPG" alt="Image of wireframe 4">

    But we ended up up choosing
<img src="./Images/wireframe.png" alt="Image of wireframe 1">
